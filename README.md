# task_list

This is a simple fullstack project. Currently the project needs frontend UI polishing. I have just finished connecting all the endpoints so that you can:
-add a task to the list
-mark the task as complete

The back end uses a Flask framework and uses an sqlite3 database.
This is the second fullstack project I have created but the only one published right now.
I intend to keep making small projects like this until I can set up backend/frontend communication rapidly in order to get into the polishing more quickly.
I may transition to using SQLAlchemy for multi threading, instead of having to define multi threading in sqlite3

---- COLLABORATORS ----


If you are here as part of the collaboration group feel free to look over the project and suggest ideas.
The frontend is ready for polishing and if you read this before I have done any of that, have at it if you like.


---- FUTURE REFACTORING ----

I don't really care to use forms too much but I do enjoy the simplicity they provide when passing the data between functions. If I get to the polishing I will more than likely end up refactoring the Form elements into simple divs so that I can customize the UI.
